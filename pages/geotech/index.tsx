        <h3>Experience, skills & local knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          Backyard Bores & Geotech Drilling Pty Ltd have drilled thousands of
          soil sampling and groundwater test holes and installed hundreds of
          ground water monitoring wells between Bowen and Rockhampton over the
          last 20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have drilled and installed <em>3 times*</em> the number of
          monitoring wells around Mackay compared to any other drilling company.
          Why? Because our team uses the right equipment with the right
          processes and the right methods for the right reason by utilising
          wisdom, judgment and discretion in the pursuit of your project&apos;s
          goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Licenced drillers - Every monitoring well logged</h3>
        <p>
          Backyard Bores & Geotech Drilling Pty Ltd have Queensland licensed
          drillers and we log every monitoring well we drill as required by the
          obligation of our licenses. Ask your other drilling companies if they
          are using a licensed driller and if that driller logs EVERY monitoring
          well. Consequences for all involved are harsh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every well deeper than 6m <strong>MUST</strong> be drilled by a
          licensed driller and a log submitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Workplace Health & Risk</h3>
        <p>
          We care about our team&apos;s health and risk levels at work and have
          WH&R Policies and Procedures, WH&R Plans, SWMS, and JRAs that put the
          crew first. As at January 2022 we have a{' '}
          <em>zero lost time injury rate</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>PFAS PFOS Firefighting Foam</h3>
        <p>
          We have have drilled hundreds of soil sampling and groundwater test
          holes and installed dozens of ground water monitoring wells in
          suspected PFAS / PFOA areas. Our very strict PFAS drilling quality
          control process allows for the most accurate samples possible. Please
          contact us for more information.
