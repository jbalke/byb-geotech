          Let Backyard Bores and Geotech Drilling{' '}
          <strong>reduce your paperwork and administrative overhead</strong> by
          providing you with one quote to cover NDD, underground utility
          locating, concrete cutting and coring, drilling, providing samples and
          installing monitoring wells.
        </p>
        <p>We have a long-term working relationship with Mackay&apos;s best:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>NDD (vacuum truck) company </li>
          <li>
            Underground utility locators with GPR (ground penetrating radar)

          <li>Concrete cutter and corer (up to 300mm thick)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Experience, skills & local knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          Backyard Bores & Geotech Drilling Pty Ltd have drilled thousands of
          soil sampling and groundwater test holes and installed hundreds of
          groundwater monitoring wells between Bowen and Rockhampton over the
          last 20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have drilled and installed <b>4 times*</b> the number of monitoring
          wells around Mackay compared to any other drilling company. Why?
          Because our team uses the right equipment with the right processes and
          the methods for the right reason by utilising wisdom, judgment and
          discretion in the pursuit of your project&apos;s goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Licensed drillers - Every monitoring well logged</h3>
        <p>
          Backyard Bores & Geotech Drilling Pty Ltd have Queensland licensed
          drillers, and we log every monitoring well we drill <b>as required</b>{' '}
          by the obligation of our licenses. Ask the other drilling companies
          quoting on jobs if they are using a licensed driller and if that
          driller logs EVERY monitoring well. Consequences for all involved in
          not logging monitoring wells are harsh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every monitoring well deeper than 6m <strong>MUST</strong> be drilled
          by a licensed driller, and a log submitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Workplace Health & Risk</h3>
        <p>
          We care about our team&apos;s health and risk levels at work and have
          WH&R Policies and Procedures, WH&R Plans, SWMS, and JRAs that put the
          crew first. As of January 2024, we have a{' '}
          <b>zero lost time injury rate since 2012</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>PFAS PFOS Firefighting Foam</h3>
        <p>
          We have drilled hundreds of soil sampling and groundwater test holes
          and installed dozens of groundwater monitoring wells in
          suspected/confirmed PFAS / PFOA areas. Our rigorous PFAS drilling
          quality control process allows for the most accurate samples possible.{' '}
