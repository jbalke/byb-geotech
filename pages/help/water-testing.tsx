        <p>
          <b>For Homeowners</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can arrange a simple bore water quality test for <b>free</b>*.
        </p>
        <p>We can test levels of the following properties:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Salt - Sodium Chloride (NaCl) - in PPM(Parts Per Million).
              &#8804;150 is great
            </li>
            <li>
              TDS - Total Dissolvable Solids/Salts (sodium, magnesium, calcium,
              potassium) - in PPM. &#8804;250 is great
            </li>
            <li>
              pH - Power of Hydrogen (acidity or alkalinity). 6.5 to 7.5 is
              great
            </li>
            <li>
              TDI - Total Dissolvable Iron (Fe) in PPM. &#8804;0.1 is great
            </li>
            <li>
              Conductivity - a measure of the ability of water to pass an
              electrical current, measured in micro siemens per centimetre.
              &#8804;400 is great
            </li>
            <li>Free Chlorine - FCl in PPM. 0 is great</li>
            <li>
              ORP - Oxidation Reduction Potential measures a substance&apos;s
              ability to oxidise or reduce another substance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Total Hardness - Water hardness is caused by alkaline earths,
              primarily calcium and magnesium. 0 is great
            </li>
            <li>Alkalinity - As a backup to pH. Neutral is great.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          *We can conduct these tests for free if we are in your area at the
          time and don&apos;t need to make a special trip just for your test. If
          you can wait, we will drop by and do the tests for free the next time
          we are going past. Otherwise a nominal fee will apply.

          Backyard Bores and Geotech Drilling can bring all the equipment
          necessary to complete the job. We can come to your bore location and
          bring:
          <ul>
            <li>
              one of several styles and models of pumps with variable flow rates
              from 0.1 L/s to 35L/s
            </li>
            <li>water level logging equipment</li>
            <li>water flow rate logging equipment</li>
            <li>a laptop to view logged data in realtime</li>
            <li>
              hoses/poly pipes, connectors and fittings to complete the task
            </li>
            <li>
              water quality testing apparatus for free onsite water quality
              testing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          After we collect the data and complete the onsite test, including bore
          recharge (as per Australian Standard AS2368â€“1990), we can analyse the
          data to produce our certified flow rate test report with trends to
          assist your submission to the council.{' '}
